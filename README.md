# skill scraper

I queried the bejesus out of LinkedIn's API for skills and it turns out they don't readily expire or rate limit the requests so I generated a list of thousands of skill tags in `skills_v4.json`.

Feel free to use this for whatever without attribution because I certainly did not get permission from Microsoft to blast their endpoint 👍
